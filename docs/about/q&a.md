# Q&A

## Does the module support Nuxt 2 ?

No, the module at least requires Nuxt 3.

## How does MapLibre compare to Mapbox ?

[Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) is a mapping platform that provides a suite of tools to create maps and location-based services. It includes similar features to MapLibre, but with paid plans for more advanced services.

Think of MapLibre as an open-source technology, while Mapbox is a complete collection of advanced tools and services.

:::tip Quote from [MapLibre's Github repository](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js)
MapLibre originated as an open-source fork of mapbox-gl-js, before their switch to a non-OSS license in December 2020.

The library's initial versions (1.x) were intended to be a drop-in replacement for the Mapboxâ€™s OSS version (1.x) with additional functionality, but have evolved a lot since then.

Both are great choices, it depends on your needs and budget.

If you want to use Mapbox with Nuxt, you can use the [Nuxt Mapbox](https://nuxt.com/modules/nuxt-mapbox) module.

## How does MapLibre compare to Leaflet ?

[Leaflet](https://maplibre.org/) is very similar to MapLibre, as it is an open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.

The main difference is that Leaflet is more mature and has a larger community, while MapLibre is a fork of Mapbox GL JS, which is a more modern library.

Again, both libraries are great choices, it depends on your needs and preferences.

If you want to use Leaflet with Nuxt, you can use the [Nuxt Leaflet](https://leaflet.nuxtjs.org) module.
