::: info
For further documentation, you can refer to the [vue-maplibre-gl documentation](https://indoorequal.github.io/vue-maplibre-gl/examples/use-map.html) that already include guides, API references, and examples.

If you find any errors related the Nuxt module (a composable not available for example), please open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gugustinette/nuxt-maplibre).

::: tip
Note that composables are exported with the `Mgl` prefix added to the name of the composable. For example, the `useMap` composable is exported as `useMglMap`.
